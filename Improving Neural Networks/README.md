# Improving Neural Networks

## Introduction

This course will teach you the "magic" of getting deep learning to work well. Rather than the deep learning process being a black box, you will understand what drives performance, and be able to more systematically get good results. You will also learn TensorFlow. 

After 3 weeks, you will: 
- Understand industry best-practices for building deep learning applications. 
- Be able to effectively use the common neural network "tricks", including initialization, L2 and dropout regularization, Batch normalization, gradient checking, 
- Be able to implement and apply a variety of optimization algorithms, such as mini-batch gradient descent, Momentum, RMSprop and Adam, and check for their convergence. 
- Understand new best-practices for the deep learning era of how to set up train/dev/test sets and analyze bias/variance
- Be able to implement a neural network in TensorFlow. 

This is the [second course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/deep-neural-network) of the Deep Learning Specialization.

## Prerequistes
You will need to install the following Packages
 - Numpy
 - MatplotLib
 - h5py
 - PIL
 - Scipy
 - skLearn
 - TensorFlow
  
You can donwload them using [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/)
```
pip install numpy h5py Pil scipy sklearn  matplotlib 
```
or [conda](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/python)
```
conda install numpy h5py Pil scipy sklearn  matplotlib 
```

In order to install TensorFlow head over to the [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) site and follow the instructions
