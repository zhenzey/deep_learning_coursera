# Deep Learning Specialization

Projects from the [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) from [deeplearning.ai](https://www.deeplearning.ai/) offered by Coursera.

**Instructor: [Andrew Ng](http://www.andrewng.org/)**

## Master Deep Learning and Break Into AI

*If you want to break into AI, this Specialization will help you do so. Deep Learning is one of the most highly sought after skills in tech. We will help you become good at Deep Learning.*

*In five courses, you will learn the foundations of Deep Learning, understand how to build neural networks, and learn how to lead successful machine learning projects. You will learn about Convolutional networks, RNNs, LSTM, Adam, Dropout, BatchNorm, Xavier/He initialization, and more. You will work on case studies from healthcare, autonomous driving, sign language reading, music generation, and natural language processing. You will master not only the theory, but also see how it is applied in industry. You will practice all these ideas in Python and in TensorFlow, which we will teach.*

*You will also hear from many top leaders in Deep Learning, who will share with you their personal stories and give you career advice.*

*AI is transforming multiple industries. After finishing this specialization, you will likely find creative ways to apply it to your work.*

## Prerequisites

The Code is written in Python 3.6.5 . If you don't have Python installed you can find it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). If you are using a lower version of Python you can upgrade using the pip package, ensuring you have the latest version of pip. 

To install pip run in the command Line
```
python -m ensurepip -- default-pip
``` 
to upgrade it 
```
python -m pip install -- upgrade pip setuptools wheel
```
to upgrade Python
```
pip install python -- upgrade
```
 You will also need to install additional packages depending the Course you are following and the relevant assignement. Seperate ReadMes will guide you for each individual course

## Viewing the Jupyter Notebook

In order to better view and work on the jupyter Notebook I encourage you to use [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) . You can simply copy and paste the link to this website and you will be able to edit it without any problem. Alternatively you can clone the repository using 
```
git clone https://github.com/fotisk07/Deep-Learning/
```
then in the command Line type, after you have downloaded jupyter notebook type
```
jyputer notebook
```
locate the notebook and run it.
